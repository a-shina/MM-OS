# Multithreading vs Multitasking in OS – C program

• This program compares the execution time of multithreading against multitasking using Linux terminal.

• The execution time is based on a workload that calculates the sum of variables from 0 up to N where 
N = {100000000,1000000000,10000000000} in each case.

• Both multithreading and multitasking implementations are tested with 2, 4, and 8 threads/tasks respectively to evenly divide the N values.

• Both multithreading and multitasking should match the values from the baseline implementation.

• The results could change for different hardware specifications as it is tied to the performance of the machine.
